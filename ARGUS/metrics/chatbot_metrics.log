Let's get to the point: when dealing with an uncooperative bed, it's essential to methodically troubleshoot and adjust the leveling process. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you tame that level:

1. **Re-level the printer**: Ensure the print head is at its default height (usually marked on the print head itself). Leveling the bed in a controlled environment with no objects nearby will make it easier.
2. **Check the leveling screws**: Verify that they're not stuck or seized. If you find any issues, lubricate them with some WD-40 or a similar product to ensure smooth movement.
3. **Adjust the leveling feet (if applicable)**: Some printers have adjustable feet; check if this is the case with your Flash Forge. Make sure they're evenly spaced and adjusted for optimal bed leveling.
4. **Use a bubble level (optional but recommended)**: Place a bubble level on the print bed to ensure it's perfectly horizontal. This will help you achieve accurate leveling.
5. **Adjust the leveling screws in small increments**: Start with small adjustments (0.1-0.2 mm) and re-level the printer after each adjustment. Repeat this process until the bed is properly leveled.
6. **Double-check the print head position**: Verify that the print head is at its default height and centered on the print bed. This will ensure accurate leveling and printing.
7. **Run a test print (optional)**: Print a simple object, like a calibration cube or a small square, to verify that the printer is properly leveled.

If you've tried these steps and still encounter issues, consider consulting the user manual or contacting Flash Forge support for further assistance.

Remember, leveling is an iterative process. Be patient, take your time, and don't hesitate to ask if you need additional guidance.

Now, go forth and conquer that level (pun, Response Time: 65.214367, Reward: 25

root - INFO - 2025-07-13 19:03:31, User Input: tell me how Apple was founded, Bot Response: A blast from the past! Apple's founding story is a fascinating one. Here's the concise lowdown:

Apple Computer (later just Apple) was founded on April 1, 1976, by three visionaries: Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne.

The trio started in Jobs' parents' garage in Los Altos, California. Wozniak, an electronics whiz, had designed the Apple I, a personal computer that could be built using a kit. Jobs, with his entrepreneurial spirit, saw an opportunity to sell the boards and convinced Wozniak to partner up.

Ronald Wayne, a friend of Jobs', was initially brought in as a third partner. He even wrote the company's first partnership agreement. However, after just 12 days, Wayne sold his 10% stake back to Jobs and Wozniak for $800. It seemed like an insignificant decision at the time...

The Apple I, released in June 1976, was one of the first personal computers on the market. It gained popularity among hobbyists and electronics enthusiasts.

In January 1977, Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak introduced the Apple II, which revolutionized the industry by being one of the first highly successful mass-produced personal computers.

The rest, as they say, is history. Apple went public in 1980, and the company's innovative products have since transformed the world.
