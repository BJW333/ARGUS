    "bot_response": "The theory of relativity, proposed by Albert Einstein in 1905 and further developed in his 1916 paper \"Relativity\", is a fundamental concept in physics that describes the relationship between space, time, mass, and energy. It has two main parts: special relativity, which deals with objects moving at constant speeds, and general relativity, which deals with gravity and accelerating frames of reference.\n\nSpecial relativity states that as an object approaches the speed of light (299,792 kilometers per second), its mass increases and time slows down for it relative to a stationary observer. This means that if you were to travel at near-light speeds, you would experience less time than someone who stayed on Earth.\n\nGeneral relativity is more complex but essentially states that gravity isn't just an attractive force between objects with mass; instead, it's caused by the curvature of space and time itself. This means that massive objects like stars or planets cause a distortion in spacetime around them, which we perceive as gravity.\n\nSo there you have it: Einstein's theory of relativity! It's pretty wild stuff when you think about it, isn't it?",
